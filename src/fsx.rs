//! Cross-platform filesystem wrapper.
//!
//! On Unix we transparently re-export std::fs. On Windows the implementation
//! is backed by `cap_std`, and Unix permission bits are stored in an alternate
//! data stream (`":unix_meta"`) so that extracting an archive can restore the
//! original mode when round-tripping between platforms.
//!
//! At the moment only a minimal subset is implemented; additional helpers will
//! be filled in as code is migrated. The goal is to let the rest of BlitzArch
//! import `crate::fsx::*` instead of touching `std::fs` directly, keeping the
//! call-sites identical across OSes.
//!
//! NOTE: All functions currently fall back to `std::fs` so that nothing breaks
//! during the transition. Full Windows handling will be added incrementally.
